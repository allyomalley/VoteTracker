## VoteTracker iOS App

VoteTracker is an app designed to keep you informed about your representative's votes in Congress, and to hold them accountable. You will be able to track your representatives, be notified of each vote that takes place, view how your representatives and all representatives voted, and lookup contact data for your reps. Vote data is scraped directly from the official records of the United States House of Representatives and Senate, and you will be notified within an hour of votes taking place, or occasionally within an hour of their posting into the public record.
